# My Movie Game - React/Redux Web App

A personal project made for fun with React and its ecosystem.

## Demo

Try it out in the demo!

[DEMO](https://themovie-2ff61.firebaseapp.com/)


You get a movie plot and you have to guess the movie title!

Obviously it's not competitive by any means as it uses a public API ( www.themoviedb.org ).

## Main Technologies

Webpack, ES6, React, Redux, Firebase, Material-UI 

# Start The Project

1. npm install
2. Add Firebase Config in src/js/firebase/firebase.js
3. Add The Movie Database API Key in src/js/actions/actions.js line: 261
4. npm start
5. Open http://localhost:8080/
