# My Movie Game - React/Redux Web App

A personal project made for fun and exercise with React and its ecosystem.

## Demo

https://mymoviegame.com/

Try it out in the demo! 

You get a movie plot and you have to guess the movie title!

Obviously it's not competitive by any means as it uses a public API ( http://www.omdbapi.com/ ).

## Main Technologies

Webpack, ES6, React, Redux, Firebase, Material-UI 

## Install the Project

Install - `npm install`

Start - `node server.js`

Open http://localhost:3000 in the browser
