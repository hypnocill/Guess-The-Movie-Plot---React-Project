# My Movie Game - React/Redux Web App

A personal project made for fun with React and its ecosystem.

## Demo

Try it out in the demo!

[DEMO](https://themovie-2ff61.firebaseapp.com/)


You get a movie plot and you have to guess the movie title!

Obviously it's not competitive by any means as it uses a public API ( www.themoviedb.org ).

## Main Technologies

Webpack, ES6, React, Redux, Firebase, Material-UI
